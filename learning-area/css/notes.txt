CSS

selector {
  property: value;
}

Selector specificity
element < class < attribute = pseudo class

inherit:
Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of 
its parent element. Effectively, this "turns on inheritance".

initial:
Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of
that property.

revert:
Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's 
default styling rather than the defaults applied to that property. This value 
acts like unset in many cases.

revert-layer:
Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value 
established in a previous cascade layer.

unset:
Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is 
naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.
